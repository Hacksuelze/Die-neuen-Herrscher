The New Rulers Modpack
The TNR modpack from Hacks√ºlze replaces 12 of the 16 vanilla AIs and is made for players looking for new challenges and a refreshing gaming experience.
DNH includes complete video messages and spells for all characters in addition to many dozens of AI castles.

The 12 characters are a varied mix of historical AIs and comedy AIs designed to entertain.
The level of difficulty also ranges from very easy to maximum challenge.
Whether you want to relax and experience the atmosphere of the game with rulers such as the Doges of Venice or Robin Hood or put your skills to the test against opponents such as HandOfBlood, Udwin and Hackerman, there are AIs available for every situation.

History
DNH began in 2019 with the release of the Vlad AI for UCP version 2.12, making it the first full custom AI for Stronghold Crusader.
Since then, many more AIs have joined the ranks and the modpack has become well known thanks to the HandofBlood AI.
Since the release of the twelfth AI in 2022, work on further characters has been discontinued, but the modpack is still being maintained.

All included AIs were created by me, with support from Monsterfish, Nevikov and a few others.
